	<h2>Types of telescopes for personal use.</h2>
	<h3>There are 3 types of telescopes used by amature astronomers.</h3>
	<h4>Refractor<br></h4>Have a lense at the front of the tube
	<h4>Reflector<br></h4>Gather light using a mirror at the rear of the main tube
	<h4>Compound<br></h4>Use a combination of lenses and mirrors<br>

	<h2><strong>Mount types</strong></h2>
	<h3>There are 2 main mount types and 1 subtype.</h3>	
	<h2>Equatorial</h2>	
	<p>Equatorial mounts are superior to non-computerized Altazimuth mounts for astronomical observing over long periods of time and absolutely necessary for astrophotography. As the earth rotates around its axis, the stationary stars appear to move across the sky. If you are observing them using an Altazimuth mount, they will quickly float out of view in both axes. A telescope on aproperly aligned equatorial mount can be aimed at a celestial object and easily guided either by either manual slow-motion controls or by an electric motor.</p>
	<h2>Altitude-azimuth (alt-az)</h2>
	<p>Altazimuth (sometimes called alt-az) is the simplest type of mount with two motions, altitude (vertical) and azimuth (horizontal): thus the name Altazimuth. Good Altazimuth mounts have slow-motion knobs for making precise adjustments, aiding smooth tracking across the sky. These type mounts are generally good for terrestrial observing and for scanning the sky at lower power but not for deep sky photography. Some Altazimuth mounts are now computer driven and allow a telescope to track the sky more accurately. This is generally good for visual use but can lose tracking on longer exposure astrophotography.
	In addition to a standard Altazimuth, mounted on the top of a tripod, there is also the Dobsonian Mount.</p>	
	<h2>Subtype of alt-az - Dobsonian</h2>		
	<p>The Dobsonian mount is a newer, modified version of the Altazimuth mount. This mount was invented in 1956 by John Dobson. Dobsonian mounts are mounted on the ground by a heavy platform, and designed to support massively sized Newtonian Reflectors, while keeping a steady image. It is common for Dobsonian telescopes to have very large apertures - anywhere between 6 and 20+ inches!</p>

		<div id="description"> 8 INCH HDOPTICAL TUBE <br>HD optics produce a focal plane more than three times flatter than a standard Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope and dramatically flatter than competing coma-free designs. This guarantees you visibly sharp stars across full frame sensors.  </div>
		<div id="middle">PERFECT FOR BEGINNER ASTROPHOTOGRAPHERS <br>This telescope is an excellent instrument for those looking to explore astroimaging. Itâ€™s the only fork-mounted telescope in its price range that offers brass worm gears along with improved motors, which provide great tracking accuracy. Capture images of the Moon and planets by attaching any planetary imaging camera  </div>
